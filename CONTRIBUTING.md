# Forks

Forks are allowed so long they abide by [Tenshi's LICENSE](LICENSE)

When creating a fork, remember to:

- Avoid confusion with the main app by:
    - Changing the app name (strings/shared_app_name)
    - Changing the app icon
    - Changing the OAUTH redirect URL
- To avoid conflicts while installing:
    - Change the 'applicationId' in build.gradle
- To allow login:
    - [Create a new API Client](https://myanimelist.net/apiconfig)
        - Please use a different redirect URL for your fork
    - Update the redirect URL
        - in Urls.java
        - in AndroidManifest.xml
    - Create a Secrets.java and paste your client id

## Sample Secrets.java

To Allow Login with your Fork, you'll have to create a file 'Secrets.java' in '/app/src/main/java/io/github/shadow578/tenshi/secret/'

```java
package io.github.shadow578.tenshi.secret;

/**
 * A class for secrets, excluded from GIT
 */
public final class Secrets {

    /**
     * MAL client ID of this application
     */
     //TODO: paste your MAL client id here and rename to Secrets.java
     // You can obtain one here: https://myanimelist.net/apiconfig
     // Please make sure this file is NOT tracked by git after adding your client ID
    public static final String MAL_CLIENT_ID = "";
}
```

# Code Style Guidelines

These are the guidelines you should follow when contributing code to Tenshi.<br>
These Guidelines outline what I think are useful rules to create readable and manageable code, tho they are always open for discussion(i'm not a professional developer after all, so what do i know :P)

- Please use Java
- Do not hardcode random values (like intent extras, ...), but use constants in the appropriate classes instead
- Avoid hardcoding URLs, use constants in Urls.java instead
- Use Enums instead of string / integer constants (especially in MAL model)
    - Enum values are in PascalCase (i know, java default is all uppercase, but that look stupid)
    - Use @SerializedName if the enum name differs from eg. an API requirement
    - Use EnumHelper instead of Enum functions to allow for @SerializedName
- Write descriptive JavaDoc comments for:
    - __all__ classes, interface and enums
    - __all__ public fields and enum constants
    - __all__ public methods
    - _optionally_ private fields and methods
- Use @Nullable / @NonNull annotations on:
    - __all__ public fields and methods
    - _optionally_ private fields and methods
- Usage of Lambda expression for handlers and callbacks is __strongly encouraged__.
- Try to use [Tenshis language extensions](./LANG.md) instead of writing extra code.
